\chapter{Theoretical Background}

% In your case, it could for instance contain the math of camera models, the theory of feature point detection and matching, motion field models, in your case in particular the model of a moving plane, parameterization of motion in terms of rotation matrices and translation vectors, and how they are computed from a set of feature point correspondences
