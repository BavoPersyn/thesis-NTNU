After reading into Homography and Visual Odometry I started experimenting with OpenCV. The first step was writing a little program that fills a buffer with pictures and simply shows them on screen. The images in this FIFO queue will in a later stage be used to detect keypoints en determine the translation-, rotation- and normal vector. This way the movement of a car can be determined.
