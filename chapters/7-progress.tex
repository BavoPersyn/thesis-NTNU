After reading into Homography and Visual Odometry I started experimenting with OpenCV. The first step was writing a little program that fills a buffer with pictures and simply shows them on screen. The images in this FIFO queue will in a later stage be used to detect keypoints en determine the translation-, rotation- and normal vector. This way the movement of a car can be determined.

I've already done the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item read all images of a folder
    \item display all images of a folder and go through them step by step (with multiple stepsizes)
    \item read video and convert every frame to a gray-scale image and save it to a folder
    \item display a menu that gives you the choice of what you want to do:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item read video(s)
        \item go through images in a folder
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}
The menu makes it easy to try out the different functionalities and check if everything works as expected. It's also easy to experiment with OpenCV this way.
The next step is to read images and store them in a buffer as described. This will be the next item added to the menu.

Images of a sequence stored in a folder can now be read into a buffer, going back and forth is perfectly possible. Jumping multiple frames is also implemented but isn't working properly yet.

The way videos are read has been changed so it stores the original images instead of converting them already. The read function also writes info about the size and length of the sequence, this is stored in a text-file. The buffer-function now reads the images and crops them, downsamples them and converts them to gray scale before adding the image into the buffer leaving us with only the important info of the images.
