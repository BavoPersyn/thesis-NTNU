\chapter{Project Status and Plans for future Action}

\section{Happened since last meeting (25/02/2022)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rewriting of project journal
    \item Researching keypoint detection in OpenCV
    \item Refactoring of code to eliminate duplicate code
    \item Original images in buffer, processing done by separate function
    \item Research keypoint detection
    \item Research ORB
    \item Simple ORB detection and matching added
    \item ORB, ignoring ego car
    
\end{itemize}
\section{Ongoing work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ORB with bucketing
    \item Calculate Homography ${H}$ (there are not enough keypoints sometimes)
    \item calculate rotation matrix ${R}$, translation vector $\vec{t}$ and normal vector $\vec{n}$ out of Homography ${H}$
\end{itemize}
\section{Plan for next period}

\section{Long Term Plans and Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item determine translation-, rotation- and normal vector
\end{itemize}
