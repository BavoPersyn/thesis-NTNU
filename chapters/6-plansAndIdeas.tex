\chapter{Project Status and Plans for future Action}

\section{Happened since last meeting (/04/2022)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculation of Homography (based on manually selected matched keypoints)
    \item Decomposing homography into Rotation matrix, translation vector and normal vector
    \item Calculation of Essential matrix (based on manually selected matched keypoints)
    \item Decomposing essential matrix into Rotation matrix and translation vector
    \item translating rotation matrix into Euler angles
    \item Visualisation of rotation angles and translation
\end{itemize}

\section{Ongoing work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deciding which combination of rotation/translation is the right one?
    \item Taking the motion parameters, and assume they remain the same for the next pair of frames, and thus making predictions for
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the horizon line
        \item the approximate position of a point tracked from image N to N+1 into frame N+2
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
