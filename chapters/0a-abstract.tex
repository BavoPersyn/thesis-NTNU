\chapter*{Abstract}

Environment perception is an important component of an autonomous racing car. In this thesis, it shall be investigated how information about the geometrical environment of the racing car can be obtained from visual image sequences. It should be investigated whether a classical model based approach, a machine learning approach or a combination of these is most appropriate for a lightweight software implementation.
