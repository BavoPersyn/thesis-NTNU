\section{Visual Odometry}
To estimate the frame-to-frame motion of the racing car, footage from a camera mounted to the car is used. This process is called Visual Odometry. The changes motion induce in the images are being used to estimate that motion. Visual Odometry needs sufficient illumination in the environment, enough texture and sufficient overlap between the consecutive frames.

The Homography is the transformation between the planes in the respective frames.

 Also valid is this: 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        X_1' \\
        X_2' \\
        X_3'
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \MH
    \begin{pmatrix}
        X_1 \\
        X_2 \\
        X_3
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation} 

So it is clear that there is a relation between $\MH$ on the one hand and $\MR$ and $\vt$ on the other hand.\bigskip
---------------------
OpenCV has a method \textit{findHomography} to find this Homography based on the keypoints detected and matched. We need to use this homography to compute rotation-matrix $\MR$ and translation-vector $\vt$.

---------------------
To match these keypoints, the region around the keypoint is looked at. This is called keypoint description and based on the description, matches are made between keypoints in different images. These matches hold the information to calculate the motion of the car.\bigskip

There are a lot of different methods and algorithms to find keypoints, describe them and match them.\bigskip

One way to match the keypoints is a Brute-Force Matcher. It is a rather simple matcher that takes the descriptor of a feature in image 1 and matches this descriptor with all the descriptors of image 2. It calculates the distance between these descriptors and returns the closest match. Different distance measurement types can be used. Cross checking is also a possibility, this means that matches are checked both ways. The matcher only returns those matches that are closest in both directions.

---------------------
A homography relates the transformation between two planes up to a scaling factor. I will discuss the scale ambiguity later. A homography matrix is a $3\times3$ matrix with 8 degrees of freedom as we have an unknown scale factor.\bigskip
